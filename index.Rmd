## Abstract

By using simple linear regression I studied the data of Italian secondary school students alcohol consumption. I was especially interested in what the relation between alcohol consumption, family relations and final grades were. 

## Research question

In my final assignment I will take a look at the Italian secondary school student alcohol consumption dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. I am interested in analysing the relation between alcohol use, attitude towards parents and family in general and course grades. My hypothesis is that higher alcohol consumption and lower grades leads to  bad quality of family relationship.  

# Analysis

Let’s begin our analysis by importing the data wrangled in data wrangling part. There are few extra variables added to the dataset in the wrangling part. 
```{r warning = F, message = F}
setwd("~/GitHub/IODS-final/data")
alc <- read.csv("alc.csv")
alc <- alc[,2:38]
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(GGally)
library(tidyr)
library(corrplot)
```
```{r}
#Let's take a look at the dimensions first
dim(alc)
```
We can see that the data has 382 observations of 37 variables. Next let's take a look at the structure.

```{r}
#Structure
str(alc)
```
We can see that there are numerical, integer, logical and binary variables. Explanations for variables are below:

1. school - student's school (binary: 'GP' - Gabriel Pereira or 'MS' - Mousinho da Silveira) 
2. sex - student's sex (binary: 'F' - female or 'M' - male) 
3. age - student's age (numeric: from 15 to 22) 
4. address - student's home address type (binary: 'U' - urban or 'R' - rural) 
5. famsize - family size (binary: 'LE3' - less or equal to 3 or 'GT3' - greater than 3) 
6. Pstatus - parent's cohabitation status (binary: 'T' - living together or 'A' - apart) 
7. Medu - mother's education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5th to 9th grade, 3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ secondary education or 4 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ higher education)
8. Fedu - father's education (numeric: 0 - none, 1 - primary education (4th grade), 2 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5th to 9th grade, 3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ secondary education or 4 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ higher education)
9. Mjob - mother's job (nominal: 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g. administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other') 
10. Fjob - father's job (nominal: 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g. administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other') 
11. reason - reason to choose this school (nominal: close to 'home', school 'reputation', 'course' preference or 'other') 
12. guardian - student's guardian (nominal: 'mother', 'father' or 'other') 
13. traveltime - home to school travel time (numeric: 1 - <15 min., 2 - 15 to 30 min., 3 - 30 min. to 1 hour, or 4 - >1 hour) 
14. studytime - weekly study time (numeric: 1 - <2 hours, 2 - 2 to 5 hours, 3 - 5 to 10 hours, or 4 - >10 hours) 
15. failures - number of past class failures (numeric: n if 1<=n<3, else 4) 
16. schoolsup - extra educational support (binary: yes or no) 
17. famsup - family educational support (binary: yes or no) 
18. paid - extra paid classes within the course subject (Math or Portuguese) (binary: yes or no) 
19. activities - extra-curricular activities (binary: yes or no) 
20. nursery - attended nursery school (binary: yes or no) 
21. higher - wants to take higher education (binary: yes or no) 
22. internet - Internet access at home (binary: yes or no) 
23. romantic - with a romantic relationship (binary: yes or no) 
24. famrel - quality of family relationships (numeric: from 1 - very bad to 5 - excellent) 
25. freetime - free time after school (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high) 
26. goout - going out with friends (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high) 
27. Dalc - workday alcohol consumption (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high) 
28. Walc - weekend alcohol consumption (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high) 
29. health - current health status (numeric: from 1 - very bad to 5 - very good) 
30. absences - number of school absences (numeric: from 0 to 93) 
31. G1 - first period grade (numeric: from 0 to 20) 
32. G2 - second period grade (numeric: from 0 to 20) 
33. G3 - final grade (numeric: from 0 to 20, output target) 
34. alc_use - average of weekday and weekend alcohol consumption (numeric)
35. high_use - alc_use is higher than 2 (logical) 
36. parent_highEDU - (both) parents education level at least secondary school (logical)
37. parent_home - (both) parents work at home (logical)

Before the analysis I created new variables and combined datasets: student-mat and student-por. The alc.csv data I use in this analysis has only observations of those people who attended both courses. Those mentioned above were done in the data wrangling part of the final assignment.  

## Visualization

```{r}
# Selecting the variables that relate to our research question
variables <- c("age", "failures", "famrel","health","G3","alc_use","parent_highEDU", "parent_home")

alc2 <- select(alc, one_of(variables))
ggpairs(alc2) + ggtitle("Correlations and distributions")

corrplot(cor(alc2), method = "color" ,type="upper", cl.pos="b", tl.pos="d",tl.cex=0.6, order = "AOE")
```

  
Above you can see distributions and correlations. First plot is plotted by command "ggplot". The scatter plots (lower left) and distributions (diagonal) are a bit messy because there are many logical variables and the other variables can only get certain discrete values. The second plot is only the correlations. As you can see there is a strong negative correlation between the final grade and failures. This is not surprising. One of the highest positive correlations can be seen in the correlation between parents education and grades. 

## My method of choice

I chose linear regression as my method of analysis. Linear regression is a basic way to examine if a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting the outcome and which variables are good predictors of the dependent variable. When only one variable is used as a explanatory variable, it is called simple linear regression. When there is more than just one explanatory variable, it is called multiple linear regression.

## Presentation of results

```{r}
jitt_famrel <- alc2$famrel+rnorm(length(alc2$famrel),sd=0.5)
jitt_alc_use <- alc2$alc_use+rnorm(length(alc2$alc_use),sd=0.5)
jitt_G3 <- alc2$G3+rnorm(length(alc2$G3),sd=0.5)


my_model <- lm(famrel ~ alc_use, data=alc2)
summary(my_model)
plot(y=jitt_famrel,x=jitt_alc_use)
abline(my_model,col="red")
```
  
First I added some (normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 0.5) jitter to my variables of interest. After that I made a summary of a linear model with famrel as a target variable and alc_use as explanatory variable. It seems that alc_use statistically is a significant explainer of variable famrel. You can see the jittered plot with famrel on the Y-axis and alc_use on the X-axis just below the summary. When alc_use grows famrel gets smaller and smaller.  

```{r}
my_model <- lm(famrel ~ G3, data=alc2)
summary(my_model)
plot(y=jitt_famrel,x=jitt_G3)
abline(my_model,col="red")
```
  
Next let's take a look at final grade (G3) as the explanatory variable. It isn't as good as alc_use as an explanatory variable. A p-value of 0.246 means that it is not statistically significant explanatory variable to famrel. This means that we can not reject the nullhypothesis of "famrel does not depend on value of grade". The red line on the scatter plot is closer to a vertical line than in the previous scatterplot.

```{r}
my_model <- lm(G3 ~ alc_use, data=alc2)
summary(my_model)
plot(y=jitt_G3,x=jitt_alc_use)
abline(my_model,col="red")
```
  
Now finally let's take a look at alc_use as the explanatory and G3 as target variable. This time the p-value is as low as 0.0022 which means that we reject the nullhypothesis of "final grade does not depend on alcohol consumption".  

## Conclusion and discussion

It seems that the Italian secondary school student alcohol consumption dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository does and does not support the nullhypothesis I set at the beginning. Quality of family relations do not affect the final grades gotten but it does affect alcohol usage. The better the quality of family relations are, the less student uses alcohol. 

It would have been better if the data had a variable in which there were exact amount of alcohol used in portions or as liters of pure alcohol rather than students own feeling of how much they used.
